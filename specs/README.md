# Specs — osrm-backend-k8s

Living catalog of every spec in this repository. Agents must update this file when adding, renaming, or removing specs. All content is English and must stay synchronized with the code.

## Catalog

| Spec | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| [product-overview.md](./product-overview.md) | Business context, value, customers, ecosystem relationships, external constants |
| [architecture.md](./architecture.md) | Tech stack, databases, models, modules, CI, local development, deployment, testing |

## Spec authorship rules
1. Extend an existing spec rather than creating near-duplicates.
2. Create a new file when a topic needs sustained independent detail.
3. Keep specs synthetic, precise, and useful for AI agents; not historical archives.
4. Never leave loose specs outside `specs/`.
5. After edits, verify [../AGENTS.md](../AGENTS.md) links remain valid.
